# PY_PROGRESSION
A respository containing files of all projects assigned by either my mentor, my books or even little things I come up with myself as I progress through learning the python programming language.

Update 11/18/2023:

As it stands now, I a couple more projects from this book which I've completed which will be uploaded to this repository, however I unfortunately will be discontinuing the usage of "Automate The Boring Stuff With Python" for a learning material which better suits my learning style. This repository will remain available for viewing.
